# neural-network-introduction

**Disclaimer:**
The implementation of the neuralNetwork is from [Tariq Rashid](https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork).



## Explanation

This project is my little crappy introduction into neuralNetworks and the use of one to classify humanwritten digits.

## To-Do's

- [ ] make neuralNetwork weights storable for use after restart
- [ ] create a canvas for drawing digits
    - [ ] make them detectable by the neuralNetworks query, forcing a prediction to be made
